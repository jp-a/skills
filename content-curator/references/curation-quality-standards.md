# Curation Quality Standards

This document defines the criteria for assessing and curating captured content.

## Quality Dimensions

### 1. Depth

**High Depth:**
- Provides detailed explanations of mechanisms and causes
- Includes multiple layers of insight (what, why, how, when)
- Explores edge cases and nuances
- Connects to broader context and implications
- Example: Detailed breakdown of why LLM pre-training has cognitive deficits, with technical explanation and practical implications

**Medium Depth:**
- Covers main concepts clearly
- Provides some explanation of why/how
- Includes key context
- Example: Overview of AI writing principles with basic explanations

**Low Depth:**
- Surface-level description only
- Lists facts without explanation
- Minimal context or implications
- Example: "AI can help with writing" without further elaboration

**Curation Action:**
- High: Prioritize for detailed extraction and cross-referencing
- Medium: Extract core insights, note limitations
- Low: May still curate if novel, but flag as "surface-level"

---

### 2. Novelty

**High Novelty:**
- Presents new frameworks or mental models not seen before
- Challenges conventional wisdom with compelling evidence
- Identifies patterns others haven't articulated
- Provides unique perspective from direct experience
- Example: "Verification replaces credentialing in AI job market" - novel framing of systemic change

**Medium Novelty:**
- Reframes known concepts in useful ways
- Combines existing ideas into new insights
- Provides fresh examples of known principles
- Example: Applying known architecture principles to new AI use case

**Low Novelty:**
- Repeats widely-known information
- Restates concepts without new angle
- Generic advice or observations
- Example: "AI is changing how we work" without specifics

**Curation Action:**
- High: Feature prominently, deep extraction
- Medium: Curate for useful framing or examples
- Low: Reference only, don't extract unless confirms critical insight from high-novelty sources

---

### 3. Reliability

**High Reliability:**
- Claims supported by evidence (data, research, specific examples)
- Author has demonstrated expertise or direct experience
- Transparent about limitations and uncertainties
- Internally consistent logic
- Can be verified or cross-checked
- Example: Citi CEO's earnings call statement about developer time savings (verifiable, high-stakes context)

**Medium Reliability:**
- Reasonable arguments with some support
- General expertise but no specific evidence cited
- Mostly consistent but some hand-waving
- Plausible but not proven
- Example: Industry expert's assessment based on observation

**Low Reliability:**
- Unsupported claims or opinions
- Contradicts known evidence
- Speculative without acknowledgment
- Internally inconsistent
- Example: Bold prediction without reasoning

**Curation Action:**
- High: Curate with confidence, can build frameworks on this
- Medium: Curate but note confidence level, useful for hypotheses
- Low: Curate separately as "speculative" or skip if redundant

---

### 4. Actionability

**High Actionability:**
- Provides specific steps or methods
- Includes concrete examples with enough detail to replicate
- Offers clear decision criteria
- Includes implementation guidance
- Example: Detailed meeting notes prompt with structure, constraints, and validation checks

**Medium Actionability:**
- Provides general approach or framework
- Examples help but lack some details
- Principles that guide but don't prescribe
- Example: "Use process over outcome" with conceptual explanation

**Low Actionability:**
- Theoretical or philosophical only
- No clear path to application
- Inspirational but vague
- Example: "Think differently about AI" without specifics

**Curation Action:**
- High: Extract detailed examples and methods
- Medium: Extract principles and frameworks
- Low: May curate for conceptual understanding, note practical limitations

---

### 5. Coherence

**High Coherence:**
- Internally consistent logic throughout
- Fits with established patterns from other sources
- Clear line of reasoning
- No major contradictions
- Example: Framework where all parts reinforce each other

**Medium Coherence:**
- Generally consistent with some tension points
- Mostly aligns with other sources
- Minor logical gaps that don't undermine core insight
- Example: Good framework with one debatable assumption

**Low Coherence:**
- Internal contradictions
- Conflicts with reliable sources without explanation
- Logical fallacies or gaps
- Example: Claims that contradict each other within same source

**Curation Action:**
- High: Curate as reliable knowledge
- Medium: Curate but note tensions or assumptions
- Low: Curate separately with critical notes, or skip

## Combined Quality Assessment

### Tier 1: Premium Content (Curate in Depth)
- High on 3+ dimensions
- At least Medium on all dimensions
- No Low scores

**Curation Approach:**
- Extract everything of value
- Create detailed principle and example documentation
- Feature in topic overviews
- Use as foundation for frameworks

### Tier 2: Quality Content (Standard Curation)
- High on 1-2 dimensions
- Medium on most others
- No more than 1 Low score

**Curation Approach:**
- Extract key insights
- Document notable examples
- Cross-reference appropriately
- Note any limitations

### Tier 3: Supplementary Content (Light Curation)
- Medium on most dimensions
- May have Low scores on 2+ dimensions
- Still provides value in specific areas

**Curation Approach:**
- Extract unique contributions only
- Use primarily for cross-validation
- Note quality limitations
- May skip if redundant with higher-tier sources

### Tier 4: Low-Value Content (Minimal or Skip)
- Low on 3+ dimensions
- Provides little unique value
- Redundant with better sources

**Curation Approach:**
- Generally skip unless fills specific gap
- If curated, mark clearly as "Low Confidence" or "Unverified"

## Special Considerations

### Evolving Sources

For sources with multiple items over time:
- Track quality trajectory (improving, stable, declining)
- Note if author's thinking evolves or contradicts earlier positions
- More recent may supersede older content
- Document evolution in source curation notes

### Contradictions Between Sources

When high-quality sources contradict:
- Curate both perspectives
- Document the tension explicitly
- Analyze when each might apply
- May indicate emerging or unsettled area
- Higher synthesis value

### Specialized vs. Generalist Content

**Specialized:**
- May score lower on breadth/coherence across topics
- But very high on depth within domain
- Curate for domain-specific insights

**Generalist:**
- May score lower on depth
- But high on connecting across domains
- Curate for pattern recognition and cross-references

## Quality Indicators (Quick Assessment)

When scanning content, look for:

**Positive Indicators:**
- ✅ Specific examples with numbers/names/details
- ✅ "Here's why this fails..." (understanding of failure modes)
- ✅ "This works when X, but not when Y" (boundary conditions)
- ✅ References to research, data, or documented cases
- ✅ Admission of limitations or unknowns
- ✅ Step-by-step methods or frameworks
- ✅ Challenges conventional wisdom with reasoning

**Negative Indicators:**
- ❌ Vague generalizations without examples
- ❌ "Everyone knows..." or "Obviously..." (unsupported)
- ❌ No acknowledgment of trade-offs or limitations
- ❌ Internal contradictions
- ❌ Hyperbolic claims without evidence
- ❌ Purely aspirational/motivational
- ❌ Restates common knowledge without new angle

## Documenting Quality in Curation

Always include quality assessment in:
- Source curation notes (overall source quality)
- Topic files (note when drawing from lower-confidence sources)
- Cross-references (weight connections by source quality)

Use confidence indicators:
- **High Confidence:** Tier 1 content, can build on this
- **Medium Confidence:** Tier 2 content, useful with caveats
- **Low Confidence:** Tier 3 content, supplementary only
- **Speculative:** Interesting but unproven, treat as hypothesis
